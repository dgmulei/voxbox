  "interpretation": "The survey reveals a polarized attitude towards the lemonade-making product, with a significant portion showing clear interest and an equal number being hesitant. This suggests a market potential with a need for targeted marketing strategies to address both the enthusiastic and skeptical segments. The uncertain group represents an opportunity for further education or product demonstration to sway their decision. Understanding the reasons behind the positive and negative responses can guide product development and messaging efforts.",
