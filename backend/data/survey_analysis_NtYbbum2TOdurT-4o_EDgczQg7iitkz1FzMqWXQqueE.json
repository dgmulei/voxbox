The 20% who find it likely suggest a moderate interest, while the 10% very unlikely and 10% neutral responses demonstrate reservations or indifference towards the unique product concept. This split in attitudes may signal a potential market for the product among a specific segment of consumers who highly value or strongly oppose such innovative ideas.",
