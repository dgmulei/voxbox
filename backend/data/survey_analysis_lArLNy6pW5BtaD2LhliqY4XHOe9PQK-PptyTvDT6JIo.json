  "interpretation": "The data shows a significant split in decision-making preferences, indicating a balanced consideration of seeking more details before acting or maintaining the status quo. The almost equal distribution between seeking information and staying points to a cautious approach to change. The 20% choosing to leave suggests a notable minority willing to make a bold move rather than maintaining the current state, highlighting contrasting risk appetites within the respondents.",
  "fun_fact": "The fact that 'Other (please specify)' and 'Unsure / Undecided' options together only account for 20% of the responses underlines the clear lean towards active decision-making and limited indecision among the participants."
